# Nimble-RPG
Switch from SDL2 to Raylib

Nimble RPG is aiming to be an open world RPG that focuses on combat and exploring.
For more details and further informations check out the "Nimble RPG.docx" file that documents the whole project.

I am currently very busy doing my Technician class so i've set the project to be done in 104 weeks (March 2025).
For detailed timestamps check "Roadmap.xlsx" that tracks each step. Also the "Nimble RPG.docx" under documentation to see if a step is already done.

I try to keep the documentation as up to date as possible to provide infos on the projects tasks.
